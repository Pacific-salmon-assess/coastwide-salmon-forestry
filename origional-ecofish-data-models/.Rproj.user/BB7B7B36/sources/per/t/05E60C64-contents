# Methods  

We compiled available data on pink salmon spawner abundance estimates and harvest and then developed and fit a state-space spawner-recruitment model to it to characterize stock dynamics and population characteristics. 
We then derived estimates of biological benchmarks to assess stock status and summarize trends. 
Lastly, we developed a simple closed-loop simulation model to quantify future expected biological and fishery performance of the current and alternative harvest control rules for the Fraser River Pink salmon stock. 
Each of these steps is described in more detail below. 

## Data sources  

Escapement and catch data was provided by *the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC - or no?)*. 
There has been concern about the comparability of sampling regimes (@grantFraserRiverPink2014; @hagueMovingTargetsAssessing2021); and some analyses have discounted data prior to 1993 (*cite salmon scanner, others?*).  
We used the description of methods in @grantFraserRiverPink2014 and knowledge from local area staff to estimate relative accuracy among sampling stanzas; no evidence suggested estimates should be systematically biased low or high, but we assumed there was variable accuracy among methods (Table \@ref(ref:spawner-est-methods)). 
We also gathered average Fraser Pink body mass data from @pacificsalmoncommissionPSCBiologicalData2023 and abundance of Pinks in the North Pacific from @ruggeroneNumbersBiomassNatural2018 for biological context.  


## Spawner-recruit model  

We modeled the spawner-recruit data in a state-space framework with auto-correlated (AR1) recruitment residuals. 
State-space models allow for the separation of observation (e.g. sampling error) and process (e.g. true variability) noise and have become popular in ecological modelling [@auger-metheGuideStateSpace2021]. 
Incorporating an AR1 structure in recruitment residuals allowed us to examine if there were serially correlated process error from one generation to the next that could arise from large scale drivers like favorable ocean conditions or carryover effects (*cite*).  
In spawner-recruit modelling this approach has been demonstrated to yield less biased estimates of biological parameters than traditional, static spawner-recruit models since it minimizes errors that can arise from errors-in-variables and time series bias [@adkisonReviewSalmonSpawnerRecruitment2021; @fleischmanAgestructuredStatespaceStock2013; @statonEvaluationMethodsSpawner2020; @suPerformanceBayesianStatespace2012].


### Process model  

The process model is intended to represent the true population dynamics (i.e., free of measurement error).
This component of our state-space spawner-recruitment model specifies productivity and density-dependence.
Recruitment abundances of adult Pinks ($R_y$) were treated as unobserved states and modeled as a function of spawner abundance in year $y$ ($S_y$) assuming a @rickerStockRecruitment1954 spawner-recruitment relationship with serially auto-correlated log-normal process variation:

<a id="eq-ricker"></a>
\begin{equation}
\ln(R_y) = \ln(S_y) + \ln(\alpha) - \beta S_y + v_y
\tag{Eqn. ?}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is productivity (intrinsic rate of growth), $\beta$ is the magnitude of within brood year density-dependent effects, and $v_y$ reflects inter-annual variation in survival from egg to adulthood, which we term "recruitment anomalies".
This variation was assumed to follow a lag-1 autoregressive process (correlation coefficient denoted by $\phi$) over time:

<a id="eq-residuals"></a>
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
v_y &= \phi v_{y-1} + \varepsilon_y \\
\varepsilon_y &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_R)
\end{aligned}
\tag{Eqn. ?}
\end{equation}

where $\varepsilon_y$ reflects the portion of the recruitment anomaly $v_y$ that is temporally independent (i.e., white noise).
The first year of recruitment was not linked to observations of spawner abundance in the spawner-recruitment relationship (eqn. [S1](#eq-ricker)) and were modeled as random draws from a log-normal distribution with mean $\ln(R_0)$ and variance $\sigma_R^2$.
Rather than estimating $\ln(R_0)$ as a free parameter as in @fleischman-etal-2013, we choose to follow @staton-etal-2020 and inform its value using the expected recruitment under equilibrium unfished conditions $\ln(\alpha)/\beta$.

Harvest in a given year ($H_y$) was modeled as the product of total run size and the harvest rate ($U_y$) experienced that year:

<a id="eq-harvest"></a>
\begin{equation}
H_y = N_y U_y
\tag{Eqn. ?}
\end{equation}

and spawner abundance ($S_y$) was modeled as the portion of $N_y$ remaining after harvest $H_y$:

<a id="eq-get-S"></a>
\begin{equation}
S_y = N_y (1 - U_y)
\tag{Eqn. ?}
\end{equation}

It is this spawner abundance $S_y$ that is used in eqn.[S1](#eq-ricker) to produce the recruitment abundance produced by spawning in brood year $y$.


### Observation model  

A state-space approach was particularly useful for this data set since we expected observation error in escapement to vary among sampling regimes (Table \@ref(tab:spawner-est-methods)).  

Observed spawner abundance was therefore assumed to be log-normally distributed with the CVs converted to log-normal variance following [@forbes-etal-2011]:

<a id="eq-get-sigma"></a>
\begin{equation}
\sigma^2_{o,y} = \ln\left(\mathrm{CV}_y^2 + 1\right)
\tag{Eqn. ?}
\end{equation}

We assumed that harvest had a 5% CV and so harvest observations were log-normally distributed with the CV converted to log-normal variance as per eqn.
[S8](#eq-get-sigma).


### Model fitting and diagnostics  

We fit the spawner-recruit model in a Bayesian estimation framework with Stan [@carpenter_stan_2017; @stan_development_team_rstan_2020], which implements the No-U-Turn Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm [@hoffman_no-u-turn_2014] for Bayesian statistical inference to generate the joint posterior probability distribution of all unknowns in the model. 
In our main model run, we sampled from 4 chains with 2,000 iterations each and discarded the first half as warm-up. We assessed chain convergence visually via trace plots and by ensuring that $\hat{R}$ [potential scale reduction factor; @vehtari2021rank] was less than 1.01 and that the effective sample size was greater than 400. Priors were weakly informative and summarized in Table \@(ref:prior-posterior-table). 


## Biological Benchmarks  

We estimated $S_{MSY}$ via the @scheuerellExplicitSolutionCalculating2016: 

<a id="eq-get-Smsy"></a>
\begin{equation}
S_MSY = 1 - W(e^1-a)/b
\tag{Eqn. ?}
\end{equation}

where $W$ is the Lambert function [@scheuerell_explicit_2016], and $\alpha$ and $b$ are intrinsic productivity and the magnitude of within stock density dependence, respectively. 
We chose to apply this exact solution for $S_{MSY}$ instead of the commonly applied @hilborn1985simplified approximation because the approximation only holds for $0 <ln(\alpha) \leq3$ and so infrequent, but large, posterior samples of $\alpha$ can result in biased estimates of the posterior distribution of $S_{MSY}$.


The harvest rate expected to lead to maximum sustainable yield ($U_{MSY}$) was derived according to the solution proposed by @scheuerellExplicitSolutionCalculating2016 as:

<a id="eq-get-Smsy"></a>
\begin{equation}
U_MSY = 1 - W(e^-log(a))
\tag{Eqn. ?}
\end{equation}

and $S_{gen}$ solved numerically in the equation:

<a id="eq-get-Sgen"></a>
\begin{equation}
S_MSY = S_gen * exp(a * (1-S_gen/b))
\tag{Eqn.}
\end{equation}

which were used as biological benchmarks to inform HCRs and evaluate their performance.  
We took 80% of $S_{MSY}$ as that is what is suggested and evaluated as a suitable upper benchmark for salmon [@dfoSustainableFisheriesFramework2022; @holtEvaluationBenchmarksConservation2009].  

The reference points above are germane to median yield and recruitment, but because of the assumption that recruitment is lognormally distributed this differs from expected (i.e., mean) yield and recruitment. Therefore, to provide inference about expected yield and recruitment we applied a lognormal bias correction by substituting $\alpha'$ for $\alpha$ in equations \@ref(eq:BMSmsy)-\@ref(eq:BMUmsy), where:

\begin{equation}
      ln(\alpha')= ln(\alpha) + \frac{\sigma_{R}}{2(1-\phi^{2})}
      (\#eq:alphaCorr)
\end{equation}


## Closed-loop simulaiton model   

Closed loop forward simulations used the existing state-space spawner-recruit model (Equation \@ref(eq:SR)) and projected population dynamics 5 generations forward (10 years). 
Simulations were done with the current and two alternative HCRs. We also included a robustness test where productivity was reduced, and saw how well the harvest control rules performed if only fit to recent data (i.e. '93 to present), which has been a cutoff used to assess Fraser Pinks in the past (e.g. @pestalStateSalmonRapid2023).  


### Biological sub-model  

Simulations began by taking one joint draw of the posterior of parameters and and the most recent year's (i.e. `r min(data$year)`) hidden states of recruits, catch, spawners, and harvest rate. 
Draws of model parameters for a given simulation were used to calculate biological benchmarks for that given draw, therefore reflecting uncertainty in the benchmarks themselves.  
 

### Fishery sub-model  

We tested one HCR that was based on the precautionary approach, where the exploitation rate (ER) is 0% when recruits are under $S_{gen}$; when recruits are between $S_{gen}$ and $U_{MSY}$ the ER increases linearly from 0% to $U_{MSY}$, then remains at $U_{MSY}$. 
This HCR makes sense intuitively, but is impractical for fisheries management. 
When looking at target escapement (Figure \@ref(figure:HCRs)) there is a slight hump where target escapment ascends from 0 to approximately 5 million spawners, but then slightly descends to $R_{S_{MSY}}$. 
This means if the forecast gets downgraded when the run is near $R_{S_{MSY}}$, the target escapement will actually increase, which is clearly problematic for management! 
A similar HCR that works with management anchors the lower operational control point (OCP) at $S_{gen}$ and the upper OCP is a function of $S_{gen}$ and $U_{MSY}$ where:  

\begin{equation}
OCP_{upper} = OCP_{lower} / (1 - U_{MSY})
\label{eq:UpperOCP}
\end{equation}  

When the recruits are below $S_{gen}$ the ER is 0%; when recruits are between $S_{gen}$ and the upper OCP escapement is fixed at $S_{gen}$, and when recruits are greater than the upper OCP ER is fixed at $U_{MSY}$ (Figure \@ref(figure:HCRs)). 

Uncertainty in management was accounted for by including forecast error and outcome uncertainty. 
Forecast error was empirically calculated based on pre-season forecasts provided by the PSC for years 1987-2021. 
We spoke with the PSC to see if we should apply and correction to account for in-season adjustments and they suggested comparing pre-season forecasts with end of season data directly. 
Lognormal forecast error was applied to recruits before applying the HCR, then outcome uncertainty applied to catch targets in the HCR functions. 
Outcome uncertainty was assumed to be normally distributed with a CV of `r OU.CV`%.  


### Performance measures  

Simulations were evaluated for each HCR and productivity regime across five metrics that encompass aspects of conservation risk and fishery objectives. 
Conservation risk was assessed by calculating 1) the percentage of years where escapement fell below $S_{gen}$, and 2) the percentage of years where escapement fell above $S_{MSY}$. 
When calculating these conservation objectives, we calculated benchmarks at the beginning of a given simulation in order to reflect underlying uncertainty in benchmark estimates; but HCRs did not change within a simulation.  
Fishery objectives were addressed by calculating 3) median annual catch, 4) catch stability (1/CV), and 5) a relative catch index; or the percentage of years that fell below an ad hoc threshold, defined as the mean catch of the highest three catches since the year 2000.  


### Robustness test and sensitivity analysis  

To address uncertainty in estimation of productivity, and to provide resilience to changing productivity forward in the simulation, we also conducted a robustness test that tested a low productivity scenario, where each HCR was tested at its reference (i.e. baseline) and robustness (i.e. low productivity) level. 
Baseline tests sampled the full posterior and robustness test sampled the lower tenth percentile of joint draws from the posterior of the productivity parameter (Ricker $\alpha$). 

Some analyses on Fraser Pinks have been cautious to use data that enumerated escapement with different methods [@pestalStateSalmonRapid2023]. 
To address this, we truncated the data to only be 1993 to present and refit the model, then used population dynamics estimated from that data in the forward simulation, under the same harvest control rules used in the other simulations.
