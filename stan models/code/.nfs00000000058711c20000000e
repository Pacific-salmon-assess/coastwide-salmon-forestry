rstan version 2.32.6 (Stan version 2.32.2)

For execution on a local, multicore CPU with excess RAM we recommend calling
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()).
To avoid recompilation of unchanged Stan programs, we recommend calling
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)
For within-chain threading using `reduce_sum()` or `map_rect()` Stan functions,
change `threads_per_chain` option:
rstan_options(threads_per_chain = 1)

Chain 7 Exception: normal_lpdf: Location parameter[9] is -inf, but must be finite! (in '/tmp/RtmpsmlT62/model-1225ae69632321.stan', line 127, column 2 to column 71)
Chain 7 If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
Chain 7 but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
